# FizzBuzz Challenge #

#### Technologies: Ruby, Rspec
#### Author : [Solène Basaïa](https://github.com/Bsolene)

## Objective ##

This was for me the opportunity to learn more about setting up a ruby project from scratch with test.

## Task ##

The objective of FizzBuzz is to create a program with the following specification:

- The program can be passed a number.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'FizzBuzz'.
- In all other cases, the program should return the given number when passed a number.

## Step ##

I split the task into several steps

- Step 1 - Setting up the local Repository
- Step 2 - Setting up the Github Repository
- Step 3 - Link Repositories
- Step 4 - Creating a test in RSPEC
- Step 5 - Make the test pass
- Step 6 - Doing Step 5 and 6 for every Task
- Step 7 - Refactoring
